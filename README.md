# spyce
The Scriptable PYthon Combat Engine
---
# Preamble
SPyCE is a passion/practice project. The aim is to:
1. Explore Python concepts
2. Learn to port code from other language
3. Gain experience with Python, Git, and other things
4. Write readable code and documentation
as such, it should *not* be taken seriously. This is mostly just a fun project to work on in my spare time, and potentially a resum√©-builder portfolio addition.
